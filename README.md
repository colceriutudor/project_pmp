#### Author : Tudor Colceriu
#### Specification : parking space sensor, using a proximity module to detect any cars that park in the degisnated parking space and alarm (with a buzzer) if the parking operation is invalid.
###### *IP address for the wifi module : 192.168.7.140 -> different devices connected will result in different requests parsed by the same system
###### *!! in order for the system to work at it's best, after a connection is made from one device and the user finished the input, disconnect the device (works anyway in 99% of the cases)
###### *Invalid parking: the parking space is already booked by someone else, or the person that parked fails to hit the "park" button in the browser to notify the system that the right vehicle is standing in the designated space.
